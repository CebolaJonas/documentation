## How it works

First match applies

Ordering of query rules is a layered approach where a vulnerability is cast against each rule until it matches one of them (this applies to muting and security inbox).

Each rule criteria is a logical AND, but if a criteria has more than one value, those are logical ORs.

## Use cases

### Mute non-urgent findings so you can prioritize immediate threats

Allows you to proactively discard findings for these known scenarios without manual intervention, so you can focus on remediating true risk. 

Proactively filter out known false positives or accepted risks from security alerts.

Use-cases:
Known false positives
Non important resources
Intentionally vulnerable areas
Ephemeral resources

### Customize your Security Inbox to highlight only what's important
