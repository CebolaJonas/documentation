title: Vulnerability Pipeline
---

overview

Available for misconfigurations, attack paths, identity risks. Will also be available for vulnerabilities <- (still being worked on/still needs work)

Ordering of query rules is a layered approach where a vulnerability is cast against each rule until it matches one of them (this applies to muting and security inbox).

Private beta this month

Each rule criteria is a logical AND, but if a criteria has more than one value, those are logical ORs.
