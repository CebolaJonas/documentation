When Datadog identifies a vulnerability, it evaluates the vulnerability against your defined sequence of inbox rules. The evaluation starts with the first inbox rule. If a vulnerability matches the criteria of this rule, it is added to the Security Inbox, and the evaluation process stops. If there is no match, Datadog examines the next inbox rule in the sequence. This process continues until a match is found, at which point the evaluation stops, or all inbox rules have been evaluated without a match.
