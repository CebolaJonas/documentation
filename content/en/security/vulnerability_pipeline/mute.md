    - **Any of these types**: The types of findings that the rule should check for. Available types include **Misconfiguration**, **Attack Path**, and **Identity Risk**.

    - **Select a reason for muting**: The reason for muting the finding. Available reasons include **Duplicate**, **External solution**, **False positive**, **Internal solution**, **No fix available**, **Accepted risk**, and **Other**.
    - **Select the rule expiration**: The date on which the rule expires. 
    - **Add further description for muting reason**: Optional box for including additional muting reason details.
1.  Enter a descriptive name for the rule in the **Rule Name** box and click **Save**.

## Manage rule matching order

When Datadog identifies a vulnerability, it evaluates the vulnerability against your defined sequence of mute rules. The evaluation starts with the first mute rule. If a vulnerability matches the criteria of this rule, it is muted for the duration specified, and the evaluation process stops. If there is no match, Datadog examines the next mute rule in the sequence. This process continues until a match is found, at which point the evaluation stops, or all mute rules have been evaluated without a match.
