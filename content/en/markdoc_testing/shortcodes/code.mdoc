### Plain code fence

Markdoc allows the custom rendering of code fences.

```javascript
// Function to compute the product of p1 and p2
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;
}
```

### Indent check

1. Do a thing. Here's the code to do that thing:
    ```python
    # Function to compute the product of p1 and p2
    def myFunction(p1, p2):
        return p1 * p2
    ```
2. Do another thing. There's no code for this thing.
3. This is a really complicated thing, hoo boy!
    - Step 1: Step one would go here.
    - Step 2: Step two would go here.
    - Step 3: Step three would go here. It has some code though!
        ```javascript
        // Function to compute the product of p1 and p2
        function myFunction(p1, p2) {
          return p1 * p2;
        }
        ```
    - Step 4: Step four would go here.
