<div class="alert alert-info">Status Events is part of the <a href="/monitors/status/status_page">provisional Monitor Status Page</a>. If you are using the legacy status page, see the <a href="/monitors/status/status_legacy">Status Page (Legacy)</a> documentation.</div>

## Overview

{{< img src="/monitors/status/status_page_event_details.png" alt="Monitor status page displaying event details" style="width:100%;" >}}

All events generated by your monitor appear on the status page, showing the groups' name, event type, and timestamp. The Event timeline also includes downtime and audit trail events.

For each event, you can access Quick actions and view related assets, like dashboards and logs.

## Event details section

To explore each individual event for more information, including associated tags and action:

1. From the monitor status page, scroll down to the **Event timeline.**   
2. Click on an event in the timeline to view event details.  
   
Use the event details to understand monitor alerts and identify root causes. This information supports responder workflows and helps you stay informed about ongoing situations. 

### Take action to remediate

With Quick Actions, you can take action without leaving the Status page. Responders save time since the context is automatically added.

| Action | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Mute  | Create a [downtime][3] to mute monitor alerts. |
| Resolve | Temporarily set the monitor status to 'OK' for its next evaluation |
| Declare Incident | Escalate monitor alerts with [Incident Management][4]. |
| Create Case | Create a [case][5] to keep track of this alert investigation without leaving Datadog. |
| Run Workflow | Run [Workflow][6] Automation with predefined snippets to run mitigation actions. |

### Resolve

You can resolve a monitor alert from the status page Header or Event details sections. Resolving from the Event details section only affects the group related to the selected event while resolving from the Header resolves all groups in the alert and sets the monitor status to 'OK' (all groups).

The monitor `resolve` function is artificially switching the monitor status to `OK` for its next evaluation. The next monitor evaluation is performed normally on the data the monitor is based on.

If a monitor is alerting because its current data corresponds to the `ALERT` state, `resolve` has the monitor follow the state switch `ALERT -> OK -> ALERT`. Therefore, using `resolve` is not appropriate for acknowledging the alert or telling Datadog to ignore the alert.

Manually resolving a monitor is appropriate for cases where data is reported intermittently. For example, after triggering an alert the monitor doesn't receive further data so it can no longer evaluate alerting conditions and recover to the `OK` state. In that case, the `resolve` function or the `Automatically resolve monitor after X hours` changes the monitor back to an `OK` state.

A typical use case is for monitors based on error metrics that only report when errors occur, like `aws.elb.httpcode_elb_5xx` or specific DogStatsD counters reporting errors only when an error exists.

## Event troubleshooting section

{{< img src="/monitors/status/events/event_troubleshooting.png" alt="Event troubleshooting with an example dependency map" style="width:100%;" >}}

For each event, access troubleshooting information to help responders quickly understand the context of the alert.

| Troubleshooting component     | Description    | 
| ---  | ----------- | 
| Dependency Map | When a service tag is available, either as a monitor tag or in the group, you can access a dependency map showing the status of your dependencies. |
