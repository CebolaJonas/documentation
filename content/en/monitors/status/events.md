<div class="alert alert-info">Status Events is part of the <a href="monitors/status/status_page">provisional Monitor Status Page</a>. If you are using the legacy status page, see the <a href="/monitors/status/status_legacy">Status Page (Legacy)</a> documentation.</div>

## Overview

{{< img src="/monitors/status/status_page_event_details.png" alt="Monitor status page displaying event details" style="width:100%;" >}}

All events generated by your monitor appear on the status page, showing the groups' name, event type, and timestamp. The Event timeline also includes downtime and audit trail events.

For each event, you can access Quick actions and view related assets, like dashboards and logs.

## Event details section

To explore each individual event for more information, including associated tags and action:

1. From the monitor status page, scroll down to the **Event timeline.**   
2. Click on an event in the timeline to view event details.  
   
Use the event details to understand monitor alerts and identify root causes. This information supports responder workflows and helps you stay informed about ongoing situations. 

### Take action to remediate

With Quick Actions, you can take action without leaving the Status page. Responders save time since the context is automatically added.

| Action | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Mute  | Create a [downtime][3] to mute monitor alerts. |
| Resolve | Temporarily set the monitor status to 'OK' for its next evaluation |
| Declare Incident | Escalate monitor alerts with [Incident Management][4]. |
| Create Case | Create a [case][5] if this needs further investigation and you want to correlate the alert to other Datadog products. |
| Run Workflow | Run [Workflow][6] Automation with predefined snippets to run mitigation actions. |
| Start a Collaboration | Start a [CoScreen][7] meeting and collaborate with your team. |

## Event troubleshooting section

For each event, access troubleshooting information to help responders quickly understand the context of the alert.

### Workflow History

The history of the workflow executed in response to the alert is displayed.

### Dependency Map

When a service tag is available, either as a monitor tag or in the group, you can access a dependency map showing the status of your dependencies.

### Case Management

Automatically create a case with the `@case-project` handle, or open one manually from the monitor status page to investigate a monitor alert. When a case is created, you can find related cases and navigate to the case management page for more details.
