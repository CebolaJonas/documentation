## Overview

The graphs on the monitor status page provide insights into your monitor's performance and any changes it has undergone. These graphs help you to understand why your monitor might be in an ALERT state and where to focus your troubleshooting efforts.

## Filter the page by groups or status

Depending on the query, the monitor might have multiple groups. To focus on a specific group, use the filter dropdowns to select the desired group.

{{< img src="path/to/your/image-name-here.png" alt="Your image description" style="width:100%;" >}}

You can chose to scope the page on:

Group status
: Only groups that are currently in the selected state will be shown

Muted state
: Only groups that are muted, or not, will be shown.

Group tags
: Only groups that have the selected tag will be shown.
