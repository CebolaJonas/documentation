## Overview

The graphs on the monitor status page provide insights into your monitor's performance and any changes it has undergone. These graphs help you to understand why your monitor might be in an ALERT state and where to focus your troubleshooting efforts.

## Monitor metadata

The right panel of the graph section of the monitor status page provides a high level overview of your monitor including

|  | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Groups  | Count of groups per status (Alert, Warn, No Data, Ok)  |
| Visualize as | Graph selector to toggle between the Evaluated Data, Source Data, and In Group graphs. |
| Query | The raw monitor query. A link to the Metrics explorer is also available\*. |
| Evaluation | The aggregation method applied to the Query with the evaluation window. |
| Notification count | Count of notifications sent from this monitor. |

[**UPDATE**]
\* The link to the Metrics Explorer is available only for Metrics, Event, Logs, â€¦ monitors.

## Filter the page by groups or status

Depending on the query, the monitor might have multiple groups. To focus on a specific group, use the filter dropdowns to select the desired group.

You can chose to scope the page on:

Group status
: Only groups that are currently in the selected state will be shown

Muted state
: Only groups that are muted, or not, will be shown.

Group tags
: Only groups that have the selected tag will be shown.

The evaluation graph is specific to the monitor and displays the single values compared to the threshold, aggregated from the query's series of points. For example, if the monitor evaluates the average of the query over the last 5 minutes, each datapoint shows the metric's average value for those 5 minutes. 

It matches your monitor's configuration to accurately show the monitor's status using evaluations settings and the monitor's current status.

## Source Data graph

{{< img src="path/to/your/image-name-here.png" alt="Your image description" style="width:100%;" >}}

The source graph shows the raw data points submitted to Datadog, used to generate the monitor evaluations. Use this graph to view unaltered data over time and confirm if data fluctuations or anomalies trigger alerts.

Use this graph to identify any discrepancies between raw data and expected metrics, which may indicate data collection or submission issues affecting the monitor's status.

### Restrictions of source data graph

The following monitor types are not supported by the provisional status page:

* \[**TODO**\] Add list of monitor types not supported

## In Groups

{{< img src="path/to/your/image-name-here.png" alt="Your image description" style="width:100%;" >}}

The In Groups graph displays your monitor's state transitions over time, broken out by group. It shows which groups are triggering the alert.

### Non reporting

{{< img src="path/to/your/image-name-here.png" alt="Your image description" style="width:100%;" >}}

Datadog keeps monitor groups in the UI for 24 hours unless configured differently. For more information, see [Group Retention time][1]. A dotted line in the graph can indicate: 

* A new group evaluated after monitor creation, shown as a dotted line from the start of the time period to when first evaluated.  
* A group stops reporting, then starts again, with a dotted line appearing from when it dropped out to when reporting resumes.

**Note**: This is different from a "no data" status. Host monitors and service checks set to notify on missing data are available for 48 hours.
