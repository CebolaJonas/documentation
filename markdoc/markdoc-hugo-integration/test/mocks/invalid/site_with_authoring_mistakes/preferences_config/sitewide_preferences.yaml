# This file simply lists the allowed identifiers for sitewide preferences
# such as database, host, programming_language, and so on.
# It's used to prevent authors from making a configuration mistake such as
# referring to 'datbase' instead of 'database'.
#
# The only identifier needed for the tests is `color`, but the typical
# sitewide preference identifiers could include:
# 
# - dd_agent_version
# - programming_language
# - mobile_platform
# - database
# - database_version
# - host
# - operating_system
